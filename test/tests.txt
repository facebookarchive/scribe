Scribe tests

Test 0 is a step by step list of how to run scribe and do a simple stress test.
The rest of the tests assume you're pretty familiar with scribe, and you'll 
need to edit test/tests.php to point test clients at the right place.

0) - set THRIFT_ROOT in tests.php to the location of the Thrift php library
     (this is found in lib/php of your Thrift install)
   - set SCRIBE_ROOT to the location of the genereated thrift interface for scribe
     (by default this gets created in src/gen-php)
   - mkdir /tmp/scribetest
   - bin/scribed test/scribe.conf.test
     this doesn't daemonize, so open another terminal and run:
   - php test/many_connections.php
   - test/resultChecker/resultChecker client1 /tmp/scribetest/scribe_test/scribe_test-*

1) strange inputs
   - simple_test.php and verify that two messages show
     up in the log. Look at the log with hexdump -C 
     and verify that one of the messages contains a zero byte.
   - strange_input.php and verify that nothing crashes.
     This tests very long messages and categories and
     messages and categories with strange characters

2) bad configuration
   - configure the following and check that status in fb303 is
     useful and things start to work again when the config is fixed.
       - unknown type
       - numeric fields with letters
       - directory not writable
       - directory doesn't exist
       - no stores configured

3) stress test
   - configure the server for chunk_size=1024
   - run stress_test.php from a couple of hosts simultaneously
     using different client names
   - run resultChecker for every client to verify all the 
     messages are stored on the central server in order.
   - hexdump -C <logfile> | more 
     and verify that a message starts on every 1024 byte
     boundary.

4) error handling
   - start a central scribe server(ie bin/scribed test/scribe.conf.test)
   - start a client scribe server(ie bin/scribed test/scribe.conf.test2)
   - start the stress test
   - stop and restart the central server
   - verify all messages have been stored on the central
     machine (a few messages could be missing if the server 
     was killed instead of shut down cleanly)

5) more error handling
   - start scribe only on the client machine
   - run the stress test
   - stop scribe on the client machine
   - start scribe on the central machine
   - start scribe again on the client machine
   - run the stress test again
   - verify all messages are stored on the central machine

6) test different start order
   - start client then central
   - start central then client

7) many connections
   - run many_connections.php from a few client machines,
     specifying a different client name for each.
     (this script has similar output to stress_test.php,
      but it opens many connections directly to the 
      central server to simulate many server machines)
   - use resultChecker to verify that all messages were
     stored on the central server. 

8) throttling and reconfig under load
   - set max_msg_per_second on central server very low
   - run stress test
   - increase max_msg_per_second on central server
   - reconfig both servers

9) test thread sharing mode
   - repeat tests with new_thread_per_category=no
   - start client but not central, run superstress.php
   - next, start up central and wait for buffered messages to send
   - use resultChecker to verify that all messages were
     stored on the central server.
