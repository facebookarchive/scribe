# scribe configuration
#
# This file specifies global key-value pairs as well as store
# objects, which are surrounded by xml-like tags <store></store>
#
# Each store has a category and a type. The category must match the
# category string used by the client code, and the type must be one of:
# file, network, bucket, buffer.  The remainder of the store
# configuration depends on the type.
#
# Some types of stores include other stores, which are specified by
# nested xml-like tags. These have specific names that depend on type.
# For example a buffer store has a <primary> store and a <secondary>
# store, which can be of any type, and are configured the same way
# they would be in a top-level <store>. Note that nested stores don't
# have a configured category, it is inherited from the top-level store.
#
# The category "default" is a special case. Any category not configured
# here will be handled using the default configuration, except with
# filenames overwritten with the category name.
#
# The parser isn't great, so add whitespace at your own risk.
