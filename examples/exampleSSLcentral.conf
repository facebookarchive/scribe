#
# This file configures Scribe to listen for messages encrypted using SSL on port 1463
# and write them to /tmp/scribetest.
#
# Notes:
#   SSL will not work with SMC services.
#   The server runs a bit slower in SSL mode, so only use SSL for the jumps that need it
#     (such as across the Internet, but not inside a private network).
#
# Setting this up as follows should give you the following benefits:
#   Clients will give their log messages to the correct central server.
#   Servers will only accept correct clients. A random Joe cannot inject log messages without the client.key file.
#   Data transmission between client and server are encrypted.
#
# Setting it up:
#   Run the included make_cert_pair.sh script to generate a pair of certificates (client/server).
#   Copy server.* and client.crt to a safe place on the central node.
#     In the main config set:
#       ssl_cert_file=/path/to/server.crt
#       ssl_key_file=/path/to/server.key
#       ssl_trusted_file=/path/to/client.crt
#   Copy client.* and server.crt to a safe place on the client nodes.
#     In the network store config set:
#       ssl_cert_file=/path/to/client.crt
#       ssl_key_file=/path/to/client.key
#       ssl_trusted_file=/path/to/server.crt
